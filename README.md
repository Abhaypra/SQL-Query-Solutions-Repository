# SQL Projects Repository

Welcome to my SQL projects repository! This repository contains various SQL projects where I've written queries ranging from simple to complex levels using MySQL. Below you'll find information on how to navigate and use this repository effectively.

## Writing Queries for Analysis

In this repository, you'll find SQL files where I demonstrate the use of MySQL for data analysis. Each SQL file contains queries that showcase different aspects of SQL querying, from basic operations to more advanced analytics.

## Usage

Each project is contained within its own directory. To use these projects, clone this repository and open the SQL files using your preferred MySQL client or command line interface.

## MySQL Installation

If you haven't installed MySQL yet, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit the official MySQL website: [MySQL Official Website](https://www.mysql.com/)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
